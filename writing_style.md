**Problem Persistence Language:**
- **Ongoing Challenges**: "has been a critical topic," "remains a challenge"
- **Unresolved Issues**: "however, these approaches struggle with," "poses challenges for deployment"
- **Missing Capabilities**: "lacks adaptability," "cannot," "no prior work"

### Differentiation and Positioning Strategies

**Comparative Positioning Patterns:**

### Positioning Strategy Patterns

**Three-Tier Positioning Architecture:**

1. **Acknowledgment Tier**: Recognize existing work's contributions
   - "provides robust solutions," "demonstrated that neural networks can learn"
   - "has been an active research area," "provide a foundation"

2. **Limitation Tier**: Identify constraints and gaps
   - "However, existing methods typically require," "While effective in structured environments"
   - "These methods can also fail," "but suffer from rapidly accumulating drift"

3. **Differentiation Tier**: Position novel contribution
   - "Our work addresses these limitations by," "In contrast, this work is"
   - "This paper's approach addresses," "However, 'no prior work'"

### Literature Integration Sophistication

**Citation Strategy Patterns:**
- **Authority Establishment**: Reference landmark studies and foundational work
